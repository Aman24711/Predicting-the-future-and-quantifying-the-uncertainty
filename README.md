# Predicting-the-future-and-quantifying-the-uncertainty
Dissertation project University of Leeds, MSc. Data Science and Analytics 2023/24 done by me (Aman Bhattacharyya) under the guidance of Dr. Peter Gracar.
This project involves using Gaussian Process Regression to predict stock market prices. The explanation and the steps taken along with the thought process of this dissertation can be viewed in the Dissertation PDF file.

The dissertation predicts the value/prices of 3 securities in the stock market 
1) Apple Inc., listed in NASDAQ 
2) Hindustan Unilever listed in BSE and NSE
3) S&P 500, which tracks the prices of top 500 stocks in NASDAQ.

The model predicts stock prices one month into the future under both normal market conditions and during market crashes. While it performs reasonably well in forecasting price movements and trends during stable market periods, it struggles significantly during market crashes, where predictions become highly inaccurate. The accompanying IPYNB file includes the code and a case study on Apple (AAPL) stock prices during a stable market phase. Note: The same code and the flow was used for all other securities and conditions.
